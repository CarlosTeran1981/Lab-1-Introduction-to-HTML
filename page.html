    <h1>My thoughts on Game of Thrones</h1>

    <p>
        I was a fan of this show since the first episode. It contained lots of action and drama. FIght scenes were
        amazing. I still remember in season five when "The Mountain" killed Oberyn Martell by crushing his skull.
        However, I was not a fan of the last season.

    <h2>The Ending</h2>

    <p>
        I felt that the last season was rushed into six episodes. Although I must say that the third episode "The Long
        Night" was the best of that season. I feel that this season should've been staged throughout 8 episodes at
        minimum.
